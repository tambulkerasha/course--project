${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit yelp_vis.py "The Passenger"

${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit yelp_vis.py "The Works Gourmet Burger Bistro"

This will create an HTML file which will be visible in the browser at "./yelp_vis_temp.html"

Cassandra key space: amahadev
Table names: 'yelp_business_combined', 'review_sample'
